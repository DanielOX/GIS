Mission Beaconhouse aims to provide quality education of an international standard. We aim for excellence through quality management, quality training and quality teaching, bringing benefits to our students, the community and the wider world.  vision Vision Beaconhouse values its heritage while it continues to reinvent its educational approach to meet the needs of the future. We believe that modern methods and attitudes can enable students achieve their fullest potential.  With the world and the needs of the community changing at an ever-increasing rate, Beaconhouse endeavours to be open to change, to adapt, innovate and keep pace with the goals that society expects. At Beaconhouse, our aim and belief is that through hard work and effort, students will be able to step confidently into the real and highly competitive world. We ensure that they are equipped with the ability to make mature and well-informed judgements based on a clear understanding of essential principles, concepts and moral values. This, we believe, is the best contribution we can make towards their development as productive members of society and, through them, to the country and the wider world.  history Background and History The Beaconhouse group has almost 300,000 fulltime students in eight countries and is possibly the largest school network of its kind in the world. Established in November 1975 as the Les Anges Montessori Academy with 19 toddlers, Beaconhouse has since grown into an international network of private schools, imparting distinctive and meaningful learning to students all the way from birth â€“ through its partnership in Pakistan with Gymboree Play & Music â€“ to post-graduation, through Concordia Colleges and the Beaconhouse National University.  Of these students, close to 105,000 study at the groupâ€™s flagship network, the Beaconhouse School System, in Pakistan as well as overseas, while the remaining are largely enrolled at The Educators, a parallel school network operated by the group.  The Beaconhouse of today is thus much more than just a stand-alone school. Through distinct and independent divisions across multiple destinations including the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Oman, the UAE, Pakistan and Belgium, it caters to the education and training needs of a large and diverse group of individuals of varying ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities, with its activities also extending beyond education in some countries.', 1, '33.78539', '72.732031'),

Our range of products includes:Food Items,Meat/Fish/,Chicken,House hold,Personal Care,Textile / Linen,Fruit & Vegetables,Hygiene / Chemical Group, Stationery,Garments / Hosiery,Furniture.  Canteen Stores Department (CSD) has passed through various stages, since its inception in 1913.  Army Canteen Board was the first venture, initiated primarily to cater for the British Forces in India.  During 1927-28 this Board was liquidated in favour of Canteen Contractors Syndicate (CCS) Limited.  In 1942, CCS became “CSD Government of India”. In August 1947, assets of the CSD India were divided between Pakistan and India.  Thus emerged the ‘CSD Pakistan’. It had three Transit Depots located at Karachi, Rawalpindi and Patanga (now Bangladesh) with a capital   outlay of Rs 2.8 Million. There were no CSD shops, instead there were only CSD Depots. Unit Canteen Contractors drew their requirements   directly from CSD Depots, for sale in Unit Canteens. Total manpower employed was 3 Managers, 57 Salesmen and 30 Workmen   (under a General Manager located at CSD Head Office, Karachi). All major stations had the Officers’ Shops run by the Ordnance Corps.   In 1960, Officers’ Shops were taken over by CSD. Between 1948-59, CSD enjoyed the status of a full-fledged Government Department,   with complete tax exemption / rebates / budgetary grants. CSD used to get a large allocation of foreign exchange and was primarily   trading in imported goods. In 1959, CSD was re-designated as a “Full-Fledged, Self-Sustaining Commercial Organization” under the Ministry   of Defence and CSD switched over to wholesale and retail merchandising.', 6, '33.76781', '72.755255'),
