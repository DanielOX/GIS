Actions in Reconciliation with National Demand:  21st century Pakistan badly need intellectuals for building the nation who should be Boo Ali Seena in knowledge, who can borrow their wisdom from Iqbal, reform the society like Shah Wali Ullah and Ismail Shaheed, must be Saadi & Haali in the field of poetry,should be genius like Arfa Kareem in IT field and should be innovative like Doctor Abdul Qadir Khan to develop unique arsenals for Pakistan.Accordingly Sir Syed Education Foundation has selected such a curriculum,activities and learning skills so that every child must be a valuable citizen of Pakistan and should exhibit examplary traits so that others must follow him.  Adopting Islamic Character:  Pakistani students should be aware of this historical fact that we got this piece of land in the name of Islam. Our all material development would be a source of loss if we fail to develop Islamic culture,awareness to Quran and Sunnah in our generation here.The global wave of Secularism is prevailing all over and we have to save our Islamic customs and traditions and our national identity.Sir Syed Education Foundation never compromises on the religious and patriotic grooming of our kids. Nationalism is emphasized in our campuses round the clock and Quranic and Islamic learning is provided to all our young kids.Our campuses intends to produce honest,religious,skillful ,beneficial ,productive human beings instead of suicidal bombers,extremist,corrupt persons.  Love with Learning:  Intellectual abilities of the students are a sacred liability of the nation. And this liability can only be paid when students engage themselves with attaining knowledge wholeheartedly during period of their schooling. On completion of secondary standard education, they should be able to explode their intellectual abilities for the benefit of the nation. Had the brave people among our ancestors not stability and courage and desire to learn,we would not have got muhaddis like Imam Bukhari and philosophers like Hakeem Abu Nasar Faraabi,Maulana Azad, Khawaja Haali, Maulvi Nazir Ahmed, Allama Shibli Noumani, Allama Iqbal and certain others. Sir Syed Education Foundation accept the challenge to export such philosophers,scholars,intellectuals for Pakistan.  Defense of the Country:  Competing the offensive intentions of the global hostilities, there is only one option left with us to implement the compulsory army training system in our country under which our youth may be trained in martial activities along with formal education to defend the country.Our campuses are providing marshal art training to students of all classes to enable them to defend themselves in situation of attacks and war like scenarios.  High Aims:  Its the obligatory duty of a young kid to determine his goal and ambition in life. Its must to put efforts in right direction to achieve the destination successfully. One of the scholars say “in order to get success one should know first that he has been created for which profession and then he should work hard for it without any break”. Only those people gain success in the life who put their efforts continuously.Sir Syed Education Foundation facilitates the students in achieving their aims by providing them classic guidance,unique curriculum and extra ordinary faculty.  Conversation and Communication Skills:  A student should be well versed with the advance conversation & communication skills. Conversation etiquettes have a distinguished place in the social relations. Conversation is actually a mirror to the speaker. We usually get an idea about the mental approach of a person from his words. Our campuses provide much debate,speaking opportunities to our students to convert them into confident and bold citizens.Sir Syed Education Foundation organize extra curricular competitions among our branches and we also put our students into national level competitions.  Public Service:  Best are the those human beings,who live and die for the others irrespective of their own gains.If any soul does not have sympathetic feelings for others,his life is useless. In our history Tipu Sultan, Allama Iqbal and Muhammad Ali Jinnah and even our beloved Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH)spent every micro second of their life for humanity.Sir Syed Education Foundations caters for ethical codes and moral character building of our day scholars.  Extra Ordinary skills of our Faculty members:  Our instructors do not torture the students.  Our faculty members update themselves by continuous studies.  They wear professional costumes.  They do not bring domestic tensions to school.  Complete their domestic chores in evening.  Are not afraid of losing job.  Pay heed to their hand writing.  Are fond of their religion. and patriotic to Pakistan.  Make children loyal to religion and country.  Get Knowledge of their subject with keen interest.  They are well mannered and well behaved.  Receive children with smile at gate.  Complain parents less and advise with logic.  Consider children as their responsibility and not a burden.  Work beyond the point of mastery.  Work more than the remuneration they receive and do not make demands.  They teach as a personal choice and commitment not as a duty.  Call students with their full names.  Keep records of children neat and clean and updated.  OUR PRESENT CAMPUSES  1: Abdalian Campus Main G.T Road Hassan Abdal. Ph# 0572523313  2: Ideal Campus I Wah Cantt.

Sir Syed School of Excellence proudly offers a curriculum to meet the social, religious and ethical challenges of Pakistan. Sir Syed Foundation is determined to provide extra ordinary faculty to groom and nourish the next generation of Pakistan and to ensure the excellent schooling. Moreover, the personality grooming of the learners will be the main precedence of the scheme. Our aim is to achieve optimum standards of quality education to prepare the next leadership of Pakistan and to provide unique sons of the soil to motherland.  Salient Features:  Sir Syed Education Foundation intends to convert young kids into confident,Bold,courageous members of society to face the challenges of the globalization.  To inculcate innovative,intellectual and learning qualities into our kids through extremely specialized supervision.  Provision of advanced, sophisticated learning tools,equipment and knowledge skills.  Focus on social,religious and ethical traits of the learners.  Extracurricular activities under the guidance of coaches of national fame.  National level faculty with lifelong learning attitude.  Quality education at affordable fee package.  Well stocked library for reference study.  Well-equipped science and IT labs.  Liaison between parents and teachers.  Our Students:  Students are the next leaders of the nation . Pakistan is at the verge of survival and our country strongly requires intellectuals, professionals and experts from all walks of the life to regain its prosperity and development. Sir Syed Education Foundation is chalking out such a strategy that kids who are handed over to our campuses in P.G level,must be converted into extra ordinary members of community when they leave us at matric or O-level. It is a bitter fact that only those nations survive who,nourish a skillful,confident and honest generation. Sir Syed Education Foundation is well versed with the challenges of Pakistani society. Our heads of the campuses,teaching faculty,sports coaches and all other instructors focus on the hidden capabilities and capacities of our learners and offers them such a curriculum and activities that these new kids become good human beings,IT specialist,military leaders,sportsmen,renowned professionals,religious scholars and the utmost,honest persons.We not only provide facilities of debates,declamation contest,Essay and story writing competitions,rather we offer best computer education and familiarity to Quran and Sunnah.Our ambition is that our kids should be second to none.  Ability Based Selection of Subjects:  It is crystal clear that persons with diverse abilities are needed to prop up the building, development and progress in the various circles of national life. Students should select their subjects according to their God gifted abilities so that motherland may be provided with the variety of citizens. Endless efforts are made in our campuses to facilitate learners to select suitable subjects according to their abilities.  Actions in Reconciliation with National Demand:  21st century Pakistan badly need intellectuals for building the nation who should be Boo Ali Seena in knowledge, who can borrow their wisdom from Iqbal, reform the society like Shah Wali Ullah and Ismail Shaheed, must be Saadi & Haali in the field of poetry,should be genius like Arfa Kareem in IT field and should be innovative like Doctor Abdul Qadir Khan to develop unique arsenals for Pakistan.Accordingly Sir Syed Education Foundation has selected such a curriculum,activities and learning skills so that every child must be a valuable citizen of Pakistan and should exhibit examplary traits so that others must follow him.  Adopting Islamic Character:  Pakistani students should be aware of this historical fact that we got this piece of land in the name of Islam. Our all material development would be a source of loss if we fail to develop Islamic culture,awareness to Quran and Sunnah in our generation here.The global wave of Secularism is prevailing all over and we have to save our Islamic customs and traditions and our national identity.Sir Syed Education Foundation never compromises on the religious and patriotic grooming of our kids. Nationalism is emphasized in our campuses round the clock and Quranic and Islamic learning is provided to all our young kids.Our campuses intends to produce honest,religious,skillful ,beneficial ,productive human beings instead of suicidal bombers,extremist,corrupt persons.  Love with Learning:  Intellectual abilities of the students are a sacred liability of the nation. And this liability can only be paid when students engage themselves with attaining knowledge wholeheartedly during period of their schooling. On completion of secondary standard education, they should be able to explode their intellectual abilities for the benefit of the nation. Had the brave people among our ancestors not stability and courage and desire to learn,we would not have got muhaddis like Imam Bukhari and philosophers like Hakeem Abu Nasar Faraabi,Maulana Azad, Khawaja Haali, Maulvi Nazir Ahmed, Allama Shibli Noumani, Allama Iqbal and certain others. Sir Syed Education Foundation accept the challenge to export such philosophers,scholars,intellectuals for Pakistan.  Defense of the Country:  Competing the offensive intentions of the global hostilities, there is only one option left with us to implement the compulsory army training system in our country under which our youth may be trained in martial activities along with formal education to defend the country.Our campuses are providing marshal art training to students of all classes to enable them to defend themselves in situation of attacks and war like scenarios.  High Aims:  Its the obligatory duty of a young kid to determine his goal and ambition in life. Its must to put efforts in right direction to achieve the destination successfully. One of the scholars say “in order to get success one should know first that he has been created for which profession and then he should work hard for it without any break”. Only those people gain success in the life who put their efforts continuously.Sir Syed Education Foundation facilitates the students in achieving their aims by providing them classic guidance,unique curriculum and extra ordinary faculty.  Conversation and Communication Skills:  A student should be well versed with the advance conversation & communication skills. Conversation etiquettes have a distinguished place in the social relations. Conversation is actually a mirror to the speaker. We usually get an idea about the mental approach of a person from his words. Our campuses provide much debate,speaking opportunities to our students to convert them into confident and bold citizens.Sir Syed Education Foundation organize extra curricular competitions among our branches and we also put our students into national level competitions.  Public Service:  Best are the those human beings,who live and die for the others irrespective of their own gains.If any soul does not have sympathetic feelings for others,his life is useless. In our history Tipu Sultan, Allama Iqbal and Muhammad Ali Jinnah and even our beloved Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH)spent every micro second of their life for humanity.Sir Syed Education Foundations caters for ethical codes and moral character building of our day scholars.  Extra Ordinary skills of our Faculty members:  Our instructors do not torture the students.  Our faculty members update themselves by continuous studies.  They wear professional costumes.  They do not bring domestic tensions to school.  Complete their domestic chores in evening.  Are not afraid of losing job.  Pay heed to their hand writing.  Are fond of their religion. and patriotic to Pakistan.  Make children loyal to religion and country.  Get Knowledge of their subject with keen interest.  They are well mannered and well behaved.  Receive children with smile at gate.  Complain parents less and advise with logic.  Consider children as their responsibility and not a burden.  Work beyond the point of mastery.  Work more than the remuneration they receive and do not make demands.  They teach as a personal choice and commitment not as a duty.  Call students with their full names.

Ability Based Selection of Subjects:  It is crystal clear that persons with diverse abilities are needed to prop up the building, development and progress in the various circles of national life. Students should select their subjects according to their God gifted abilities so that motherland may be provided with the variety of citizens. Endless efforts are made in our campuses to facilitate learners to select suitable subjects according to their abilities.  Actions in Reconciliation with National Demand:  21st century Pakistan badly need intellectuals for building the nation who should be Boo Ali Seena in knowledge, who can borrow their wisdom from Iqbal, reform the society like Shah Wali Ullah and Ismail Shaheed, must be Saadi & Haali in the field of poetry,should be genius like Arfa Kareem in IT field and should be innovative like Doctor Abdul Qadir Khan to develop unique arsenals for Pakistan.Accordingly Sir Syed Education Foundation has selected such a curriculum,activities and learning skills so that every child must be a valuable citizen of Pakistan and should exhibit examplary traits so that others must follow him.  Adopting Islamic Character:  Pakistani students should be aware of this historical fact that we got this piece of land in the name of Islam. Our all material development would be a source of loss if we fail to develop Islamic culture,awareness to Quran and Sunnah in our generation here.The global wave of Secularism is prevailing all over and we have to save our Islamic customs and traditions and our national identity.Sir Syed Education Foundation never compromises on the religious and patriotic grooming of our kids. Nationalism is emphasized in our campuses round the clock and Quranic and Islamic learning is provided to all our young kids.Our campuses intends to produce honest,religious,skillful ,beneficial ,productive human beings instead of suicidal bombers,extremist,corrupt persons.  Love with Learning:  Intellectual abilities of the students are a sacred liability of the nation. And this liability can only be paid when students engage themselves with attaining knowledge wholeheartedly during period of their schooling. On completion of secondary standard education, they should be able to explode their intellectual abilities for the benefit of the nation. Had the brave people among our ancestors not stability and courage and desire to learn,we would not have got muhaddis like Imam Bukhari and philosophers like Hakeem Abu Nasar Faraabi,Maulana Azad, Khawaja Haali, Maulvi Nazir Ahmed, Allama Shibli Noumani, Allama Iqbal and certain others.

High Aims:  Its the obligatory duty of a young kid to determine his goal and ambition in life. Its must to put efforts in right direction to achieve the destination successfully. One of the scholars say “in order to get success one should know first that he has been created for which profession and then he should work hard for it without any break”. Only those people gain success in the life who put their efforts continuously.Sir Syed Education Foundation facilitates the students in achieving their aims by providing them classic guidance,unique curriculum and extra ordinary faculty.  Conversation and Communication Skills:  A student should be well versed with the advance conversation & communication skills. Conversation etiquettes have a distinguished place in the social relations. Conversation is actually a mirror to the speaker. We usually get an idea about the mental approach of a person from his words. Our campuses provide much debate,speaking opportunities to our students to convert them into confident and bold citizens.Sir Syed Education Foundation organize extra curricular competitions among our branches and we also put our students into national level competitions.  Public Service:  Best are the those human beings,who live and die for the others irrespective of their own gains.If any soul does not have sympathetic feelings for others,his life is useless.

Our range of products includes:Food Items,Meat/Fish/,Chicken,House hold,Personal Care,Textile / Linen,Fruit & Vegetables,Hygiene / Chemical Group, Stationery,Garments / Hosiery,Furniture. Canteen Stores Department (CSD) has passed through various stages, since its inception in 1913. Army Canteen Board was the first venture, initiated primarily to cater for the British Forces in India. During 1927-28 this Board was liquidated in favour of Canteen Contractors Syndicate (CCS) Limited. In 1942, CCS became “CSD Government of India”. In August 1947, assets of the CSD India were divided between Pakistan and India. Thus emerged the ‘CSD Pakistan’. It had three Transit Depots located at Karachi, Rawalpindi and Patanga (now Bangladesh) with a capital outlay of Rs 2.8 Million. There were no CSD shops, instead there were only CSD Depots. Unit Canteen Contractors drew their requirements directly from CSD Depots, for sale in Unit Canteens. Total manpower employed was 3 Managers, 57 Salesmen and 30 Workmen (under a General Manager located at CSD Head Office, Karachi). All major stations had the Officers’ Shops run by the Ordnance Corps. In 1960, Officers’ Shops were taken over by CSD. Between 1948-59, CSD enjoyed the status of a full-fledged Government Department, with complete tax exemption / rebates / budgetary grants. CSD used to get a large allocation of foreign exchange and was primarily trading in imported goods. In 1959, CSD was re-designated as a “Full-Fledged, Self-Sustaining Commercial Organization” under the Ministry of Defence and CSD switched over to wholesale and retail merchandising.','33.76781','72.755255');
